The Journey Begins
==================

Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Ruby Koans Tutorial. I'm Chris White, the author of this guide to getting started with Ruby. When I recently came back to Ruby after a long trip through many corners of the programming world, the koans were recommended as a starting point to understanding the language. The unique format provided the ability to explore the language in such a fascinating way that it inspired me to create a tutorial around its content. 

This tutorial is licensed [Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) to allow the community to contribute to it. Unlike a book which can become quickly outdated as the language progresses, my hope is that an open source community driven tutorial will help keep the content fresh. Welcome to Ruby, and I hope you enjoy the journey.
